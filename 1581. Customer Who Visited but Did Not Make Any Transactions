Write a solution to find the IDs of the users who visited without making any transactions and the number of times they made these types of visits.

Return the result table sorted in any order.
SQL:    select v.customer_id, count(v.visit_id) as count_no_trans
        from visits v 
        left join transactions t
        on v.visit_id = t.visit_id
        where t.transaction_id is null
        group by v.customer_id;

PANDAS:     df1 = visits
            df2 = transactions
        
            df = pd.merge(left=df1, right=df2, how='left', on='visit_id')
            fc = df['transaction_id'].isnull()
            return df[fc].groupby('customer_id').agg({'visit_id':'count'}).reset_index().rename(columns= {'visit_id':'count_no_trans'})
