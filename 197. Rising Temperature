id is the column with unique values for this table.
There are no different rows with the same recordDate.
This table contains information about the temperature on a certain day.
 

Write a solution to find all dates' id with higher temperatures compared to its previous dates (yesterday).

Return the result table in any order.

SQL:    select w1.id
        from weather w1, weather w2
        where DATEDIFF(w1.recordDate, w2.recordDate) = 1 and 
        w2.temperature < w1.temperature;

PANDAS:     df = weather
            df.sort_values('recordDate', inplace=True)                     #inplace is use to do chances in original data, here value wont get sorted is inplace not used)
            df['prev_day_temp'] = df['temperature'].shift(1)
            df['prev_recordDate'] = df['recordDate'].shift(1)
            df['daysdiff'] = (df['recordDate'] - df['prev_recordDate']).dt.days        #if days are like 14 & 16
            fc = (df['temperature']>df['prev_day_temp']) & (df['daysdiff']==1)
            return df[fc][['id']]
