Table: Employee

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| department  | varchar |
| managerId   | int     |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name of an employee, their department, and the id of their manager.
If managerId is null, then the employee does not have a manager.
No employee will be the manager of themself.
 

Write a solution to find managers with at least five direct reports.

Return the result table in any order.

SQL:  select e1.name
      from employee e1
      join employee e2
      on e1.id = e2.managerId
      group by e1.name, e1.id
      having count(e2.id) >=5
      
      or
       select e.name
      from employee e
      where e.id in
      (select  managerId
      from employee
      where managerId is not null
      group by managerId
      having count(*) >=5)

PANDAS: df= (employee.groupby('managerId', as_index=False)
                .agg(df1=('id', 'count'))
            )
            manager_with_5 = df[df['df1'] >= 5]
        
            result = employee.merge(manager_with_5, left_on ='id', right_on='managerId')[['name']]
            return result
