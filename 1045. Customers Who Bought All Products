Write a solution to report the customer ids from the Customer table that bought all the products in the Product table.

Return the result table in any order.

SQL:  select customer_id
      from customer 
      group by customer_id
      having count(distinct product_key) = (select count(distinct product_key) from product);
PANDAS: 
          # How many distinct products exist?
          total_products = product['product_key'].nunique()
          
          # Count how many distinct products each customer bought
          counts = customer.groupby('customer_id')['product_key'].nunique().reset_index()
          
          # Keep only customers who bought ALL products
          result = counts[counts['product_key'] == total_products][['customer_id']]
          
          return result
